Place all LLR sign images for the quiz in this folder.

Example usage in script.js:
<img src="/images/signs/stop.png" alt="Stop Sign" class="sign-image">

Recommended structure:
/images/signs/stop.png
/images/signs/give-way.png
/images/signs/compulsory-turn-left.png
...

You can add PNG or JPG images for each sign as referenced in your questions array. Make sure the file names match those used in the quiz data.

If you need sample sign images, you can download them from government or open-source road sign datasets, or create your own.
